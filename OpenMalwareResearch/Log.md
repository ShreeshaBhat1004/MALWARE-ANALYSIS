# Infrastructure as a service:
The collection of precise real-world behavior of malware has always been challenging. Malware depends on real-world conditions, Internet connectivity, and short-lived remote servers to reveal its behavior, while executing them unleashed in connected environments can have catastrophic consequences. Consequently, researchers typically rely on virtualized isolated environments, which are easily evaded by modern malware. We present JUGAAD, a first-of-its-kind malware behavior-as-a-service, which provides a real-world heterogeneous testbed with Internet connectivity to execute malware. It enables users to submit malware hashes or programs and retrieve their precise and comprehensive real-world run-time characteristics, across the computing stack, including network, operating system, and hardware. The unbiased, comprehensive view of malware activity fast-tracks research while offloading the time, effort, infrastructure, and risks involved in collecting such data.

# Labeled data as service:
Research in cyber-security is often hampered by a lack of access to ground-truth data of malware behavior in the wild. Primarily, malware is as dangerous and stealthy as a ticking time bomb, adding significant challenges to collecting their real-world behavior without being affected by its consequences. We present RaDaR, an open real-world dataset for malware behavioral analysis, with mechanisms to keep pace with the evolving malware landscape. With a comprehensive view of malware activity across the system and diverse perspectives for analyzing them, RaDaR has multiple use cases for AI-based security research, including developing novel multi-featured countermeasures and unbiased comparison of detection approaches. By abstracting the challenges in malware data collection, RaDaR opens up the cyber-security field by enabling not only security researchers, but other communities, especially data science researchers, to explore and analyze it quickly.

# Multi-featured solution:
Malware programs are diverse, with varying objectives, functionalities, and threat levels ranging from mere pop-ups to financial losses. Consequently, their run-time footprints across the system differ, impacting the optimal data source (Network, Operating system (OS), Hardware) and features that are instrumental to malware detection. Further, the variations in threat levels of malware classes affect the user requirements for detection. Thus, the optimal tuple of <data-source, features, user-requirements> is different for each malware class, impacting the state-of-the-art detection solutions that are agnostic to these subtle differences. This paper presents SUNDEW, a framework to detect malware classes using their optimal tuple of <data-source, features, user-requirements>.
